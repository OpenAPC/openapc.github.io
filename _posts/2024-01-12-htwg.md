The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [HTWG Konstanz - University of Applied Sciences](https://www.htwg-konstanz.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.

The initial data set provided by HTWG Konstanz covers publication fees for 6 articles, total expenditure amounts to 11,531€ and the average fee is 1,922€.
