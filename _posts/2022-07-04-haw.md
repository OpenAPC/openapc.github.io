The [Hamburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/) (HAW Hamburg) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data on articles published under the German DEAL agreement with Springer Nature in 2021.

The [University Information and Library Service](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/study/libraries/) (HIBS) is in charge of the [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/hibs/publizieren/publikationsfonds/).

Contact person is [Steffen Rudolph](<mailto:hibs.oa@haw-hamburg.de>).

## Cost data



The new data covers publication fees for 2 articles published in Springer Nature Gold OA journals, total expenditure amounts to 4,276€ and the average fee is 2,138€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
