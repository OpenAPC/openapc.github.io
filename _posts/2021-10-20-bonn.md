The [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/the-university?set_language=en) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data on articles published under the German DEAL agreement in the 2020 period.

The [Bonn University and State Library](https://www.ulb.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en) manages services related to [Open Access](https://www.open-access.uni-bonn.de).

Contact Person is [Dr. Daniel Rudolf](mailto:openaccess@ulb.uni-bonn.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 49 articles published in Springer Nature and Wiley Gold OA journals, total expenditure amounts to 89,177€ and the average fee is 1,820€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).

The following table provide an overwiew:

|Springer Nature |       34|             64667|          1902|
