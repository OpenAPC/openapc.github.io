The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Forschungsinstitut für Nutztierbiologie (FBN)](https://www.fbn-dummerstorf.de/) (Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.

## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the FBN covers publication fees for 22 articles, total expenditure amounts to 58,375€ and the average fee is 2,653€.
