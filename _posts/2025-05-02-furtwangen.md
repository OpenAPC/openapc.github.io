The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person is [Peter Daub](mailto:peter.daub@hs-furtwangen.de).

The new data set covers publication fees for 6 articles, total expenditure amounts to 7 437€ and the average fee is 1 240€.
