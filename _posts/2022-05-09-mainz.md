The [JGU Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/eng/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data on articles published under the German DEAL agreement with Springer Nature in the 2020 period.

[Mainz University Library](https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/) is in charge of the institution's [Open Access Publication Funds](https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/open-access/foerderkriterien-open-access),
which received support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under its [Open-Access Publishing Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/index.html#4) until 2019.

Contact person is [Karin Eckert](mailto:K.Eckert@ub.uni-mainz.de).

## Cost data



The new data covers publication fees for 3 articles published in Springer Nature Gold OA journals, total expenditure amounts to 4 146€ and the average fee is 1 382€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
