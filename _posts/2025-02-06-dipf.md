The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [DIPF](https://www.dipf.de/en) (Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for the DIPF is [Manuela Bielow](mailto:publikationen@dipf.de).

## Cost data



The new dataset covers publication fees for 2 article. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:



|                     | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:--------------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Frontiers Media SA   |        1|              1175|          1175|
|MIT Press - Journals |        1|              1357|          1357|
