The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Hochschule Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences](https://h-da.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.

Contact Person is [Katharina Emig](mailto:open-access.bib@h-da.de).


## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the HS Darmstadt covers publication fees for 15 articles, total expenditure amounts to 27,296€ and the average fee is 1,820€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set. BPCs are aggregated in OpenAPC's [BPC](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/blob/master/data/bpc.csv) dataset and are not listed here either.
