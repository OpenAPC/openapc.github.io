The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [German Institute of Human Nutrition](https://www.dife.de/en/) (DIfE) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.



## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 19 articles, total expenditure amounts to 61,419€ and the average fee is 3,233€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs: 




|                   | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:------------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Frontiers Media SA |        6|             22092|          3682|
|Elsevier BV        |        5|             17019|          3404|
|MDPI AG            |        5|             14749|          2950|
