The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Leibniz-Zentrum für Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT)](https://www.leibniz-zmt.de/de/) (Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.


## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the ZMT covers publication fees for 26 articles, total expenditure amounts to 57,672€ and the average fee is 2,218€.
