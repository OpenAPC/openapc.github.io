In May 2016 the [National Library of Sweden](https://www.kb.se/in-english.html) started their own [OpenAPC project](https://github.com/Kungbib/openapc-se) to collect cost data from Swedish HEIs. So far articles added to openapc-se have been made available to OpenAPC in a biannual ingestion interval. The [last exchange](https://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2022/02/01/openapc-se/) happened in February 2022.

From now on the National Library wants to establish a new workflow and has kindly made APC expenditures for 1 Swedish institution available to OpenAPC via pull request on GitHub.

Contact person for the National Library is [Camilla Lindelöw](mailto:Camilla.Lindelow@kb.se).

## Cost data



The dataset covers publication fees for 47 articles published in 2021. Total expenditure amounts to 71 008€ and the average fee is 1 511€.

The data originates from the University of Gävle (Have a look at the [treemaps site](https://treemaps.intact-project.org) for institutional details):
