The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [JGU Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

[Mainz University Library](https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/en) is in charge of the institution's [Open Access Publication Funds](https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/open-access/foerderkriterien-open-access),
which receives support by the DFG under its [Open Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).

Contact persons are [Susanne Janning](mailto:s.janning@ub.uni-mainz.de) and [Sascha Lauer](mailto:s.lauer@ub.uni-mainz.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 201 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 461 661€ and the average fee is 2 297€.

The following table provides an overview. Please note that BPCs are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [BPC](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/blob/master/data/bpc.csv) dataset.
