The [Technische Hochschule Brandenburg](https://englisch.th-brandenburg.de/) has updated its expenditures, providing data on APCs and on articles published under the German DEAL agreement with Wiley for the 2023 period.

The [TH Brandenburg Library](https://bibliothek.th-brandenburg.de/) manages services related to [Open Access](https://bibliothek.th-brandenburg.de/open-access-und-publizieren/).

Contact Person is [Cliff Buschhart](mailto:cliff.buschhart@th-brandenburg.de).


## Cost Data



The new APC data set covers publication fees for 1 article. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).

The following table provides an overview:



|        | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:-------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|MDPI AG |        1|              1428|          1428|
