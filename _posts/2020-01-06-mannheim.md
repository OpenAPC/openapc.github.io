The [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing more data for the 2019 period.

The [University Library Mannheim](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/) manages the university's institutional [Open Access Publication Fund](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/open-access-publishing-fund/). 
Please note that this fund is not supported by the DFG's Open-Access Publishing Programme (contrary to most German universities participating in OpenAPC), but instead by Mannheim University Library, the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Württemberg and the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES).

Contact Person is [Philipp Zumstein](mailto:philipp.zumstein@bib.uni-mannheim.de).
