We welcome the [Leibniz-Institut für Raumbezogene Sozialforschung (IRS)](https://leibniz-irs.de) as new contributing institution!

The [IRS Library](https://leibniz-irs.de/en/organisation/library) manages services related to [Open Access](https://leibniz-irs.de/en/research/publications/open-access) and has kindly provided 
an initial data set on APC expenditures for the 2021 period and on articles published under the German DEAL agreements with Wiley.

Contact Person is [Simone Vogler](mailto:Simone.Vogler@leibniz-irs.de).

## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the IRS covers publication fees for 8 articles, total expenditure amounts to 9,366€ and the average fee is 1,171€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
