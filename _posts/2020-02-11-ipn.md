The [IPN](http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/en) (Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education) has updated its APC expenditures, the latest contribution provides data for the 2019 period.

The [IPN Library](http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/en/the-ipn/library) manages the Institute's [Open Access publication fund](http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/en/the-ipn/library/open-access) which pays APCs for articles published by IPN scientists.

In addition, the IPN Library has also reported cost data on articles published under the [DEAL agreement](https://www.projekt-deal.de/wiley-contract/) with Wiley.

Contact Person is [Barbara Senkbeil-Stoffels](mailto:bsenkbeil@ipn.uni-kiel.de).

## Cost data



The new dataset covers publication fees for 24 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 50 656€ and the average fee is 2 111€.

The following table shows the payments the IPN has made to publishers in 2019. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** Wiley journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
