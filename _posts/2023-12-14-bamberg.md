The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, [University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

[Bamberg University Library](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/library/) is in charge of the [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/library/publishing/oa-publishing/funding-oa-articles/), which receives support under the [DFG's Open Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).

Contact person is [Dr. Fabian Franke](mailto:fabian.franke@uni-bamberg.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 21 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 37 847€ and the average fee is 1 802€.
