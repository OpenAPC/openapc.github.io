The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](http://www.igb-berlin.de/en) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

The [IGB Library](http://www.igb-berlin.de/en/library) manages the institution's APC expenditures and the IGB publishing fund, established in 2018.

Contact Person is [Jana Rumler](mailto:jana.rumler@igb-berlin.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 20 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 43,789€ and the average fee is 2,189€.
