The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, [Leibniz-Institut für ökologische Raumentwicklung (IÖR)](https://www.ioer.de/en/) (Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for the IÖR data is [Christoph Hornung](mailto:open-access@ioer.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 7 articles, total expenditure amounts to 14 711€ and the average fee is 2 102€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:



|                | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:---------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Elsevier BV     |        5|             12500|          2500|
|Cogitatio       |        1|               950|           950|
|Springer Nature |        1|              1261|          1261|
