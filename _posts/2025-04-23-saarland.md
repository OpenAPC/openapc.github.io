New APC data has been harvested from the [institutional repository](https://publikationen.sulb.uni-saarland.de/) of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html).

The [Saarland University and State Library (SULB)](https://www.sulb.uni-saarland.de/en/) decided to make data on APC expenditures directly available in their institutional repository, where it can be harvested by OpenAPC on a regular basis via [OAI-PMH](https://publikationen.sulb.uni-saarland.de/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=openapc&set=openapc).

In addition, the Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)". When reporting their publication costs, Saarland University had agreed to share this data with OpenAPC as well. Since cost data on regular APCs had already been aggregated via the mentioned harvesting, OpenAPC only integrated data on hybrid DEAL articles.

Contact person is [Ulrich Herb](mailto:u.herb@sulb.uni-saarland.de).

## Cost data



The new data covers publication fees for 71 articles, total expenditure amounts to 185,845€ and the average fee is 2,618€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.
