The [Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf](http://www.hzdr.de) (HZDR) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data for the 2021 period and articles published under the German DEAL agreements with Wiley and Springer Nature in 2019/2020.

The [HZDR Library](http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=73) manages the HZDR's spending on OA journals.

Contact person is [Edith Reschke](mailto:e.reschke@hzdr.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 76 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 129,311€ and the average fee is 1,701€.

The following table shows the payments the HZDR library has made to publishers in 2021. Please note that articles published in hybrid journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC’s [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
