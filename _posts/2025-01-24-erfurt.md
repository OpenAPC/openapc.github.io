The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [University of Erfurt](https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact Person for the data is [Martina Schlütter](<mailto:martina.schluetter@uni-erfurt.de>).


## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 8 articles, total expenditure amounts to 15,983€ and the average fee is 1,998€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set. BPCs are aggregated in OpenAPC's [BPC](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/blob/master/data/bpc.csv) dataset and also not listed here.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs: 




|                                 | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|

|Frontiers Media SA               |        2|              4252|          2126|
