The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Dresden](http://www.htw-dresden.de/) (Dresden University of Applied Sciences) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

The institution operates an [Open Access publishing fund](https://www.htw-dresden.de/open-access), which receives support by the DFG under its [Open Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).

Contact Persons are [Rebecca Krentz and Matthias Voit](mailto:open.access@htw-dresden.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 3 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 5,919€ and the average fee is 1,973€.
