The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Hochschule Mainz - University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-mainz.de) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.


## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the HS Mainz covers publication fees for 6 articles, total expenditure amounts to 11,665€ and the average fee is 1,944€.
