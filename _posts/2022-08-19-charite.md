The [Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://www.charite.de/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data on articles published under the German DEAL agreement in the 2021 period.

The [Charité Medical Library](https://bibliothek.charite.de/) is in charge of the institution's [Open Access Publication Funds](https://bibliothek.charite.de/publizieren/open_access/),
which is receiving support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under its [Open-Access Publishing Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/index.html#4).

Contact Person is [Jenny Delasalle](mailto:openaccess@charite.de).

## Cost data


The new data set covers publication fees for 230 articles published in Springer Nature and Wiley Gold OA journals, total expenditure amounts to 499,335€ and the average fee is 2,171€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).

The following table provide an overwiew:


|                | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:---------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Springer Nature |      182|            378379|          2079|
|Wiley-Blackwell |       46|            112388|          2443|
|EMBO            |        2|              8568|          4284|
