The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the university participate in OpenAPC for the first time.
