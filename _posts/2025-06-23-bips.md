The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Leibniz-Institut für Präventionsforschung und Epidemiologie - BIPS](https://www.bips-institut.de/en/index.html) (Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for BIPS is [Lara Christianson](mailto:christianson@leibniz-bips.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 16 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 38,386€ and the average fee is 2,399€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:



|                       | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:----------------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Springer Nature        |        9|             19907|          2212|
|Frontiers Media SA     |        3|              7339|          2446|
|JMIR Publications Inc. |        3|              8565|          2855|
|Informa UK Limited     |        1|              2576|          2576|
