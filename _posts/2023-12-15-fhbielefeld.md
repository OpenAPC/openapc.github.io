The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld](https://www.hsbi.de/en) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

The [University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld Library](https://www.hsbi.de/bib) is in charge of the [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.hsbi.de/open-access/publikationsfonds), which receives support by the DFG under its [Open-Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).


Contact person is [Kerstin Werth](mailto:open@hsbi.de).

## Cost data



The new dataset covers publication fees for 12 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 19 582€ and the average fee is 1 632€.
