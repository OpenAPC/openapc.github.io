We welcome the [Spanish National Research Council](https://www.csic.es/en/csic) (CSIC) as a new contributing institution!

CSIC, Spain's largest public research institution, has kindly decided to join the Open APC initiative and share its expenditures on Open Access publications.

Contact Person is [Karina Barros Ferradás](mailto:karina.barros@bib.csic.es).

## About the dataset

The initial data set contributed by CSIC contains information on publication fees paid from 2015 to 2023. 

## Cost data



The data set covers publication fees for 1,122 articles, total expenditure amounts to 2,251,128€ and the average fee is 2,006€. Please note that articles published under transformative agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC’s [transformative agreements data set](https://treemaps.openapc.net/apcdata/transformative-agreements/#institution/Consejo%20Superior%20de%20Investigaciones%20Cientificas%20(CSIC)/).

The following tables and plots provide an overview of the reported APC expenditures.
