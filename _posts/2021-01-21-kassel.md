The [University of Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data for the 2020 period.

[Kassel University Library](http://www.uni-kassel.de/ub/index.php) is in charge of the institution's [Open Access Publication Funds](http://www.uni-kassel.de/ub/index.php?id=37384),
which received support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under its [Open-Access Publishing Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/funding_open_access/index.html) until 2019.

In addition, Kassel University Library has also reported a final update data on articles published under the [DEAL agreement](https://www.projekt-deal.de/wiley-contract/) with Wiley in 2019.

Contact person is [Dr. Tobias Pohlmann](mailto:pohlmann@bibliothek.uni-kassel.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 79 articles, total expenditure amounts to 115 281€ and the average fee is 1 459€.

The following table shows the payments Kassel University Library has made to publishers since its last contribution. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** Wiley journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
