The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Leibniz Institute for New Materials](http://www.leibniz-inm.de/en/) (INM) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person is [Elke Bubel](mailto:elke.bubel@leibniz-inm.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 7 articles, total expenditure amounts to 19,230€ and the average fee is 2,747€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs: 



|                                 | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:--------------------------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|

|American Chemical Society (ACS)  |        1|              1854|          1854|
|Frontiers Media SA               |        1|              3610|          3610|
