The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Alice Salomon University of Applied Sciences Berlin](https://www.ash-berlin.eu/en/) (ASH Berlin) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the university participate in OpenAPC for the first time.
