The [Spanish National Research Council](https://www.csic.es/en/csic) (CSIC), Spain's largest public research institution, has kindly updated its expenditures, providing data on APCs and on articles published under transformative agreements for the 2024 period.

Contact person is [Karina Barros Ferradás](mailto:karina.barros@bib.csic.es).

## Cost data



The new dataset covers publication fees for 143 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 324 424€ and the average fee is 2 269€. Please note that articles published under transformative agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://treemaps.openapc.net/apcdata/transformative-agreements/#/Consejo%20Superior%20de%20Investigaciones%20Cientificas%20(CSIC)/) data set. 

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
