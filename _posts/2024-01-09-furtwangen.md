The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.

[HFU libraries](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/central-services/libraries/) are in charge of the University's [Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/search-for-books-and-media/), which receives support under the [DFG's Open Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).

Contact person is [Peter Daub](mailto:peter.daub@hs-furtwangen.de).
