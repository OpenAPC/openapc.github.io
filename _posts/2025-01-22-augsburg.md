The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for Augsburg is [Sonja Härkönen](mailto:openaccess@bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de).


## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 46 articles, total expenditure amounts to 123,489€ and the average fee is 2,685€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
