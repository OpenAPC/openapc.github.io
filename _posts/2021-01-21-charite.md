The [Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://www.charite.de/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing Wiley DEAL data for the 2019 period.

The [Charité Medical Library](https://bibliothek.charite.de/) is in charge of the institution's [Open Access Publication Funds](https://bibliothek.charite.de/publizieren/open_access/),
which is receiving support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under its [Open-Access Publishing Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/funding_open_access/index.html).

Contact Person is [Jenny Delasalle](mailto:openaccess@charite.de).

## Cost data


The new data set covers publication fees for 25 Gold OA articles published under DEAL. Total expenditure amounts to 49 062€ and the average fee is 1 962€.

The following table provides an overview. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** Wiley journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
