The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

The initial data set provided by the University of Cologne covers publication fees for 133 articles, total expenditure amounts to 333,543€ and the average fee is 2,508€.
