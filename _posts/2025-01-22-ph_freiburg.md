The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Pädagogische Hochschule Freiburg](https://www.ph-freiburg.de/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.



## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the PH Freiburg covers publication fees for 1 article, with an APC expenditure of 3,581€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.
