The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Anhalt University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-anhalt.de/en/start-page.html) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.


## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 10 articles, total expenditure amounts to 25 613€ and the average fee is 2 561€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs: 




|                   | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:------------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|MDPI AG            |        6|             14477|          2413|
|Frontiers Media SA |        2|              5283|          2641|
|Elsevier BV        |        1|              3237|          3237|
|SAGE Publications  |        1|              2617|          2617|
