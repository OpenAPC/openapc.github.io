The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Leibniz-Institut für Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung (IPK)](https://www.ipk-gatersleben.de/) (Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.


## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the IPK covers publication fees for 31 articles, total expenditure amounts to 81,879€ and the average fee is 2,641€.
