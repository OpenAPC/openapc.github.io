The [University of Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data for the 2019 period.

[Kassel University Library](http://www.uni-kassel.de/ub/index.php) is in charge of the institution's [Open Access Publication Funds](http://www.uni-kassel.de/ub/index.php?id=37384),
which received support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under its [Open-Access Publishing Programme](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding_opportunities/open_access/) until 2019.

In addition, Kassel University Library has also reported cost data on articles published under the [DEAL agreement](https://www.projekt-deal.de/wiley-contract/) with Wiley.

Contact person is [Dr. Tobias Pohlmann](mailto:pohlmann@bibliothek.uni-kassel.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 62 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 81 087€ and the average fee is 1 308€.

The following table shows the payments Kassel University Library has made to publishers in 2019. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** Wiley journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
