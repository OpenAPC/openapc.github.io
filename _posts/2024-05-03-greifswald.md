The [University of Greifswald](https://www.uni-greifswald.de/en/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data on articles published under the German DEAL agreements in the 2020-2022 period.

[Greifswald University Library](https://ub.uni-greifswald.de/en/library/) is in charge of the [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://ub.uni-greifswald.de/en/service/for-academics/open-access/funding/funding-open-access-gold/), which receives support by the DFG under its [Open Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).

Contact Person is [Stefanie Bollin](mailto:ub_openaccess@uni-greifswald.de).

## Cost data




The new data set covers publication fees for 81 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 162,766€ and the average fee is 2,009€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).

The following table provides an overwiew:



|                | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:---------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Springer Nature |       60|            120051|          2001|
|Wiley-Blackwell |       21|             42715|          2034|
