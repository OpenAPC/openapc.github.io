The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact Person is [Michael Zweier](mailto:Michael.Zweier@uni-passau.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 10 articles, total expenditure amounts to 15,510€ and the average fee is 1,551€.
