The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, [Leibniz-Zentrum für Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT)](https://www.leibniz-zmt.de/de/) (Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for the ZMT is [Clara Bruns](mailto:clara.bruns@leibniz-zmt.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 18 articles, total expenditure amounts to 44 861€ and the average fee is 2 492€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
