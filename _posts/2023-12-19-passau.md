The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

[Passau University Library](https://www.ub.uni-passau.de/en/) operates the University's [Open Access Publishing Funds](https://www.ub.uni-passau.de/publizieren/open-access/publikationsfonds).

Contact Person is [Lisa Spindler](mailto:lisa.spindler@uni-passau.de).

## Cost data




The new data set covers publication fees for 6 articles, total expenditure amounts to 7,883€ and the average fee is 1,314€.
