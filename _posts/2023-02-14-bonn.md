## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 144 articles published in Gold OA journals, total expenditure amounts to 280,848€ and the average fee is 1,950€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
