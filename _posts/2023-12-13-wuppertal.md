The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Bergische Universität Wuppertal](https://www.uni-wuppertal.de/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the university participate in OpenAPC for the first time.

Contact person for Wuppertal is [Dr. Christian Schäffer](mailto:schaeffer@uni-wuppertal.de).


## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the Bergische Universität Wuppertal covers publication fees for 29 articles, total expenditure amounts to 57,403€ and the average fee is 1,979€.
