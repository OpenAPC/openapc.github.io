The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, Ulm University had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Ulm's [Communication and Information Center (kiz)](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/einrichtungen/kiz.html) is in charge of the University's [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.uni-ulm.de/index.php?id=57202), which received support by the DFG under its [Open-Access Publishing Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/index.html#4) until 2016.

Contact person is [Uli Hahn](mailto:uli.hahn@uni-ulm.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 206 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 520 718€ and the average fee is 2 528€.

The following table shows the payments the kiz has made to publishers in 2021.
