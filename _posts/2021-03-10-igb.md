The [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](http://www.igb-berlin.de/en) has updated its APC expenditures, the latest contribution provides data for the 2019 period. The report also covered cost data on hybrid articles published under the [DEAL agreement](https://www.projekt-deal.de/wiley-contract/) with Wiley.

The [IGB Library](http://www.igb-berlin.de/en/library) manages the institution's APC expenditures and the IGB publishing fund established in 2018.

Contact Person is [Cliff Buschhart](mailto:buschhart@igb-berlin.de).

## Cost data



The new dataset covers publication fees for 15 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 18 153€ and the average fee is 1 210€.

The following table shows the payments the IGB Library has made to publishers in 2019. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** Wiley journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
