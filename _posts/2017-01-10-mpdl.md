The [Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL)](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/) has updated its APC expenditures for the New Journal of Physics in the second half of 2016.

MPDL provides [institutional funding for Open Access publications](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/?id=50:open-access-publishing&catid=17:open-access) for researchers affiliated with the  [Max Planck Society](http://www.mpg.de/en). MPDL makes use of central agreements with Open Access publishers.

Please note that article processing charges funded locally by Max Planck Institutes are not part of this data set. The Max Planck Society has a limited input tax reduction. The refund of input VAT for APC is 20%.

## Cost data




The new data covers additional publication fees for 29 NJP articles published by MPG researchers, which MPDL covered in 2016. Together with the [previous APC data](https://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2016/12/13/mpdl) MPDL's total expenditure for the NJP in 2016 amounts to 74 784€ and the average fee is 1 289€.
