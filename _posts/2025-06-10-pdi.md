The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Paul-Drude-Institut für Festkörperelektronik](http://www.pdi-berlin.de) (PDI) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact Person for the PDI data is [Anne Timm](mailto:timm@pdi-berlin.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 9 articles, total expenditure amounts to 34,294€ and the average fee is 3,810€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
