The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://www.charite.de/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for the Charité data is [Dr. phil. Marcel Wrzesinski](mailto:openaccess@charite.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 436 articles, total expenditure amounts to 1,108,405€ and the average fee is 2,542€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set. 


The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
