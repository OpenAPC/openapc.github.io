The [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en) (SNS) has updated its expenditures, the latest contribution provides data on APCs and BPCs for the 2024 period as well as articles published under transformative agreements in 2024.

The [SNS Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.sns.it/en/guida/how-publish-open-access-scuola-normale) supports and partially funds OA publishing at the institution.

Contact Person is [Donatella Tamagno](mailto:svr@sns.it).

## Cost Data



The new data covers publication fees for 23 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 67,248€ and the average fee is 2,924€. Please note that articles published under transformative agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC’s [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements). BPCs are aggregated in OpenAPC's [BPC](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/blob/master/data/bpc.csv) dataset and are not listed here either.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
