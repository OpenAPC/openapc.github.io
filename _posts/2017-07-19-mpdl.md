The [Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL)](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/) has reported additional APC expenditures for BMC, Copernicus and eLife journals.

MPDL provides [institutional funding for Open Access publications](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/?id=50:open-access-publishing&catid=17:open-access) for researchers affiliated with the [Max Planck Society](http://www.mpg.de/en). MPDL makes use of central agreements with Open Access publishers.

Please note that article processing charges funded locally by Max Planck Institutes are not part of this data set. The Max Planck Society has a limited input tax reduction. The refund of input VAT for APC is 20%.

## Cost data



The new dataset covers publication fees for 51 articles published by MPG researchers in the aforementioned journals. Total expenditure amounts to 87 165€ and the average fee is 1 709€.
