The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for the Bamberg data is [Dr. Fabian Franke](mailto:fabian.franke@uni-bamberg.de).


## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 22 articles, total expenditure amounts to 30,692€ and the average fee is 1,395€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
