The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [DIPF](https://www.dipf.de/en) (Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

The DIPF's [Educational Research Library Frankfurt](https://www.dipf.de/en/knowledge-resources/libraries/educational-research-library-frankfurt?set_language=en) operates the DIPF publications database and the institutional Open Access repository.

The new dataset covers publication fees for 1 article.
