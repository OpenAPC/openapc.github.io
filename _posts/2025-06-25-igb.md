The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](http://www.igb-berlin.de/en) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact Person is [Jana Rumler](mailto:jana.rumler@igb-berlin.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 9 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 18,720€ and the average fee is 2,080€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:



|                              | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:-----------------------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Wiley-Blackwell               |        5|              9870|          1974|
|Springer Nature               |        3|              6399|          2133|
|Oxford University Press (OUP) |        1|              2451|          2451|
