The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Natural History Museum Berlin](https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en) (Museum für Naturkunde) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for the Natural History Museum Berlin is [Stefanie Paß](mailto:Stefanie.Pass@mfn.berlin).

The new data set covers publication fees for 15 articles, total expenditure amounts to 27,743€ and the average fee is 1,850€.
