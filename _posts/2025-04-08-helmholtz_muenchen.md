The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Helmholtz Zentrum München](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/) (Helmholtz Munich) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.

Contact person is [Markus Hagemann](mailto:markus.hagemann@helmholtz-muenchen.de).

## Cost data



The initial data set covers publication fees for 79 articles, total expenditure amounts to 248,582€ and the average fee is 3,147€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.
