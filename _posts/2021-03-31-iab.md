The report also covered cost data on hybrid articles published under the [DEAL agreement](https://www.projekt-deal.de/wiley-contract/) with Wiley.

The IAB is a research institute and special office of the German Federal Employment Agency.

## Cost Data



The new dataset covers publication fees for 24 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 57,506€ and the average fee is 2,396€.

Please note that articles published in **hybrid** Wiley journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
