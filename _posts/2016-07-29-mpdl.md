The [Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL)](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/) has updated its APC expenditures for Springer Nature, PLoS and ScienceOpen articles in the 2015 period.

MPDL provides [institutional funding for Open Access publications](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/?id=50:open-access-publishing&catid=17:open-access) for researchers affiliated with the  [Max Planck Society](http://www.mpg.de/en). MPDL makes use of central agreements with Open Access publishers.

Please note that article processing charges funded locally by Max Planck Institutes are not part of this data set. The Max Planck Society has a limited input tax reduction. The refund of input VAT for APC is 20%.

## Cost data




The new data covers publication fees for 176 articles published by MPG researchers, which MPDL covered in 2015. Total expenditure amounts to 282 150€ and the average fee is 1 603€.

The following table shows the payments the MPDL has made to the 3 aforementioned publishers in 2015:
