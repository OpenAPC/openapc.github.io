We welcome the [Hochschule RheinMain](https://www.hs-rm.de/de/) as new contributing institution!

The [University and State Library RheinMain](https://www.hs-rm.de/en/services/university-and-state-library-rheinmain) is in charge of the [University's Publishing Fund](https://www.hs-rm.de/de/service/hochschul-und-landesbibliothek/forschen-publizieren/open-access#publikationsfonds-der-hsrm-118261).

An initial data set on both Gold APCs and hybrid OA articles published under the Springer DEAL agreement has been kindly made available to OpenAPC.

Contact Person is [Julia Dickel](mailto:openaccess-hlb@hs-rm.de).

## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the HS RheinMain covers publication fees for 16 articles, total expenditure amounts to 31,970€ and the average fee is 1,998€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.
