The [Technische Universität Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) has updated its expenditures, providing data on APCs and on articles published under the German DEAL agreements with Wiley and Springer Nature for the 2022 period.

The [University and State Library Darmstadt ](https://www.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/die_bibliothek/index.en.jsp) (ULB) is in charge of the [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/forschen_publizieren/publizieren/oa_foerderung/index.en.jsp), which is receiving support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under its [Open Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).

Contact Person is [Karen Schiele](mailto:oa-fonds@ulb.tu-darmstadt.de).

## Cost Data



The new data set covers publication fees for 130 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 216 692€ and the average fee is 1 667€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
