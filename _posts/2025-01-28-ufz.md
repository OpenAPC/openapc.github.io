The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [UFZ](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=33573) (Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person is [Ilka Rudolf](mailto:ilka.rudolf@ufz.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 175 articles, total expenditure amounts to 370 966€ and the average fee is 2 120€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:
