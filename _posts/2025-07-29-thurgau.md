The [Thurgau University of Teacher Education (PHTG)](https://www.phtg.ch/) has provided both APC and BPC expenditures for the first half of 2025.

[PHTG Campus Library](https://bibliothek.phtg.ch/de/publizieren-open-access/open-access-foerderung/) collects data on institutional APC and BPC expenditures and kindly provides these data sets to OpenAPC.

Contact person is [Stefan Willi](mailto:stefan.willi@phtg.ch).

## Cost Data



The new data set covers publication fees for 1 article. Please note that BPCs are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [BPC](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/blob/master/data/bpc.csv) dataset.
