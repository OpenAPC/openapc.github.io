In June 2014, universities and research institutions in Germany have started to explore how reporting on fee-based Open Access publishing can be made more transparent and reproducible across institutions. For the purpose of interoperation with international activities and projects, the [initial repository on fees paid by German Universities and Research Institutions](https://github.com/njahn82/unibiAPC) has now been moved to <https://github.com/OpenAPC/>

At the moment, the datasets collects information from ten institutions that share information on 1.599 articles, with total expenditure of 1.938.505 EURO (including VAT). 

### Future planning 

Beyond sharing our datasets on author fess paid, with this GitHub organisation we intend to

- inform about new developments, datasets and members
- share documentations and manuals, which will be translated from German into English
- provide exploratory analyses and tools
- offer an opportunity for other countries to report on fee-based Open Access publishing
