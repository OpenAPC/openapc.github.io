In June 2014, German Universities and Research Institutions have started to explore how reporting on fee-based Open Access publishing can be made more transparent and reproducible across institutions. Datasets which document costs per article have been made available through an [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/njahn82/unibiAPC). 

For the purpose of interoperation with international activities and projects, the [initial repository on fees paid by German Universities and Research Institutions](https://github.com/njahn82/unibiAPC) has now been moved to this [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/OpenAPC/) and is accessible under

<https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/>

At the moment, the datasets collects information from ten institutions that share information on 1.599 articles, with total expenditure of 1.938.505 EURO. 

### Future planning 

Beyond sharing our datasets on author fess paid, with this GitHub organisation we intend to

- inform about new developments, datasets and members
- share our documentations and manuals which will be translated from German to English
- provide exploratory analyses
- sharing our tools
- offer an opportunity for other countries to report on fee-based Open Access publishing
