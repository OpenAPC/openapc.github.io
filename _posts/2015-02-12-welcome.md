In June 2014, German Universities and Research Institutions have started to demonstrate how reporting on fee-based Open Access publishing can be made more transparent and reproducible across institutions. 

For the purpose of interoperation with international activities and projects, the [initial repository on fees paid by German Universities and Research Institutions](https://github.com/njahn82/unibiAPC) has been moved to this [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/OpenAPC/) and is accessible under

<https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/>

At the moment, the datasets collects information from ten institutions that share information on 1.599 articles, with total expenditure of 1.938.505 EURO. 

This blog will inform on new releases of datasets, methods used and our dissemination activities on a regular basis.
