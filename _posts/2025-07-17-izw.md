The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, [Leibniz-Institut für Zoo- und Wildtierforschung (IZW)](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/) (Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

Contact person for the IZW is [Cornelia Greulich](mailto:biblio@izw-berlin.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 11 articles, total expenditure amounts to 25 021€ and the average fee is 2 275€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs:



|                | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:---------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Wiley-Blackwell |        6|             11881|          1980|
|Elsevier BV     |        2|              7618|          3809|
|BioScientifica  |        1|              1737|          1737|
|MDPI AG         |        1|              1713|          1713|
