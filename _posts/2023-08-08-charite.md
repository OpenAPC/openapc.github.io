The [Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://www.charite.de/) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data on articles published under the German DEAL agreements in 2022.

The [Charité Medical Library](https://bibliothek.charite.de/) is in charge of the institution's [Open Access Publication Funds](https://bibliothek.charite.de/publizieren/open_access/),
which is receiving support by the DFG under its [Open Access Publication Funding Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/).

Contact Person is [Jenny Delasalle](mailto:openaccess@charite.de).

## Cost data


The new data set covers publication fees for 231 articles published in Springer Nature and Wiley Gold OA journals, total expenditure amounts to 549,066€ and the average fee is 2,377€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).

The following table provide an overwiew:



|                | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:---------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Springer Nature |      189|            438868|          2322|
|Wiley-Blackwell |       39|             96489|          2474|
|EMBO            |        3|             13709|          4570|
