The [University of Trier](https://www.uni-trier.de) has updated its APC expenditures, providing data for the 2019 period.

The [Trier University Library](https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=678&L=2) is in charge of the [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=60802), which is supported under the [DFG's Open Access Publishing Programme](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding_opportunities/open_access/).

In addition, Trier University Library has also reported cost data on articles published under the [DEAL agreement](https://www.projekt-deal.de/wiley-contract/) with Wiley.

Contact Person is [Dr. Evgenia Grishina](mailto:openaccess@uni-trier.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 21 articles. Total expenditure amounts to 33 652€ and the average fee is 1 602€.

Please note that articles published in **hybrid** Wiley journals under the DEAL agreement are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements data set](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements).
