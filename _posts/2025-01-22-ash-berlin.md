The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Alice Salomon University of Applied Sciences Berlin](https://www.ash-berlin.eu/en/) (ASH Berlin) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.



## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 3 articles, total expenditure amounts to 5,979€ and the average fee is 1,993€. 

The following table provides an overview of the reported APCs: 




|                | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid|
|:---------------|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
|BMJ             |        1|              2945|          2945|
|Elsevier BV     |        1|               785|           785|
