The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Leibniz Institute for New Materials](http://www.leibniz-inm.de/en/) (INM) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.
