The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated.

[Chemnitz University Library](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/ub/index.html.en) is in charge of the [University's Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/ub/publizieren/openaccess/index.html.en), which received support by the DFG under its [Open-Access Publishing Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/infrastructure_funding/index.html#4) until 2019.

Contact person is [Ute Blumtritt](mailto:ute.blumtritt@bibliothek.tu-chemnitz.de).

## Cost data



The new data set covers publication fees for 76 articles, total expenditure amounts to 167,719€ and the average fee is 2,207€.

The following table shows the payments the Chemnitz University Library has made to publishers in 2022.
