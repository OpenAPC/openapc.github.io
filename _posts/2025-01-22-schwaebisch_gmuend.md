The Forschungszentrum Jülich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Pädagogische Hochschule Schwäbisch Gmünd](https://www.ph-gmuend.de) (University of Education Schwäbisch Gmünd) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the institution participate in OpenAPC for the first time.



## Cost data



The initial data set provided by the PH Schwäbisch Gmünd covers publication fees for 5 articles, total expenditure amounts to 10,307€ and the average fee is 2,061€. Please note that articles published in **hybrid** journals under the DEAL agreements are not included in this list, as they are aggregated in OpenAPC's [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) data set.
