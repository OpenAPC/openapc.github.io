The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich collects publication cost data from German institutions as part of the DFG programme "[Open Access Publication Funding](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/monitoring-dfg-oa-publication-funding)".

When reporting their publication costs, the [Alice Salomon University of Applied Sciences Berlin](https://www.ash-berlin.eu/en/) (ASH Berlin) had agreed to share the data with OpenAPC as well. This data has now been transferred and integrated, making the university participate in OpenAPC for the first time.


## Cost data

```{r, cache.lazy = TRUE}
#' Download APC spreadsheet from github which requires to Curl installed

download_apc <- function(path = NULL, dir = "tmp", file = "apc_de.csv"){
  if(is.null(path)) {
    path <- c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/master/data/apc_de.csv")
    } 
  dir.create(dir) 
  download.file(url = path, destfile = paste(dir, file, sep = "/"), method = "curl")
  read.csv(paste(dir, file, sep = "/"), header = T,sep =",")
}

my.apc <- download_apc()
my.apc <- my.apc[my.apc$institution == "ASH Berlin",]
my.apc <- droplevels(my.apc)

```

The initial data set provided by the Alice Salomon University of Applied Sciences Berlin covers publication fees for `r format(nrow(my.apc), big.mark =",")` article.

```{r}
d_frame = data.frame(table(my.apc$publisher,  dnn="Publisher"))                 
d_frame = d_frame[with(d_frame, order(-Freq, Publisher)), ]                                           
                                    
my.apc$publisher <- factor(my.apc$publisher, levels =  d_frame$Publisher)

df.summary <-cbind(tapply(my.apc$euro, my.apc$publisher, length),
             tapply(my.apc$euro, my.apc$publisher, sum),
             tapply(my.apc$euro, my.apc$publisher, mean))

colnames(df.summary) <- c("Articles", "Fees paid in EURO", "Mean Fee paid")

knitr::kable(as.data.frame(df.summary), digits = 2)
```
